## Getting Started

### Example for Query a Database

*Corresponding Notion API: [Query a database](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-database-query)*

```rust

use notion_client::endpoints::{
    databases::query::request::{QueryDatabaseRequest, Sort, SortDirection, Timestamp},
    Client,
};

const NOTION_DB_ID: &str = ""; // ⚠️ Set your DB id which can be accessible from API
const NOTION_TOKEN: &str = ""; // ⚠️ Set your notion token

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Initialize client
    let client = Client::new(NOTION_TOKEN.to_string(), None);
    let Ok(client) = client else {
        panic!("error");
    };

    // Set up request parameters
    let request = QueryDatabaseRequest {
        sorts: Some(vec![Sort::Timestamp {
            timestamp: Timestamp::CreatedTime,
            direction: SortDirection::Ascending,
        }]),
        ..Default::default()
    };

    // Send request
    let res = client
        .databases
        .query_a_database(NOTION_DB_ID, request)
        .await;

    // See result
    print!("{:#?}", res);
}

```
